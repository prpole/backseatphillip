    <h1>About me</h1>
    <div class="post-text">
	<p>Working on a PhD in English, Comparative Literature, and Any Other Thing that Seems Important, I am left with just enough time to mock myself. Hence this blog, the entries to which would be brief enough to be profound were they not so obviously useless. Every day I'll stop to look at what on earth I'm looking at and take a screenshot of the relevant part of my desktop; the images will always be half-staged, but it will always also originate from some part of my daily activity. This is my version of a personal blog, because, surely, my thoughts are coextensive with my browsing history.</p>

        <p> The site is built (proudly) with Jekyll, based on the Jekyll Clean theme by Scott Emmons (see footer).
