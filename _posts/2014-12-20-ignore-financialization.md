Would that I could "ignore financialization." There were a lot of gems like this as I finished up papers for the semester. It turns out that working on academic papers requires that you use a lot of words that aren't in the dictionary, whether you're using other people's coinages, your own, or just verbed nouns. This one, though, I think is an Apple dictionary problem.
