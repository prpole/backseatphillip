Today I'm trying to geolocate a fictional place from Karen Tei Yamashita's *Through the Arc of the Rainforest* for a paper/mapping project. This is understandably difficult, but careful reading and some fiddling revealed that it was supposed to be 1,500 miles from both Fortaleza and SÃ£o Paulo, somewhere in the southern portion of the Amazon Basin. Taking Yamashita literally, I was able to drop it about there. If this seems like kind of a crazy way to spend one's time, you've probably got it about right. But they hand out degrees in it, so.
