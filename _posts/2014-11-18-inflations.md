Not that I get any say in this part, exactly. But it's hard to both think that grade inflation is a problem and understand that it has to change all at once if it is going to change: Summa does just look better on a CV (and, let's be honest, in general), and that's a non-trivial competitive advantage in certain job markets. When you're grading papers you can sort of respond to this, but when it's a test and you don't get to pick the curve, being the guy in the middle is a wee bit uncomfortable.

I remember in seventh grade when I ruined my perfect score in woodshop with a sub-optimal salt shaker. I started crying right in front of a guy named Blaine who would later get a minotaur tattooed on his calf and had to claim through a veil of snot that I had sawdust in my eye. So what I'm saying, folks, is I feel you.
