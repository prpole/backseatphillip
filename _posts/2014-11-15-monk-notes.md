Spent all day working on ways to turn manuscript markup, transcription, and annotations into dynamically generated web layouts, i.e., new ways of looking at the many and marvelous marginalia in manuscripts. Which led me to google "100 best monk notes," as though there would be a BuzzFeed article or something. 

For inquiring minds: yes, that's a nun harvesting a penis tree, and no, I'm not making it up.
