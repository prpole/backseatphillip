Pretty good formula evolving here for thanksgiving. It involves:

* (1) Stay in New York
* (2) (Try to) Protest in the morning, because civic duty 
* (3) Start drinking (lightly) at noon
* (4) Make a number of relatively small, all-vegetable dishes; the cats get tuna
* (5) Marathon some nerdy TV or movie series. Last year LotR, this year Firefly.
* (6) Decorate, i.e. get a 1.5-foot Christmas tree and tie a bow on top of it

Year two of this and it seems like the way to go.
