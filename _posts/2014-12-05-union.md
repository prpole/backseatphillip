Forgive the title, please. Today was a big step forward for the rights of graduate workers at Columbia. There's no reason to think recogntion is a sure thing, and because the Bush-appointed NLRB has more like a latrine than a legistlative body, we could be in for a disappointment. But it was still pretty inspiring, and at the end of a week in which I seem to be waving a sign as often as not, it's a good note to end on.
