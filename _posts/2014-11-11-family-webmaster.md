I have to make myself useful *somehow*, so these days I find myself as the family webmaster. The boss-as-hell [Katrina Day](http://www.katrinapday.com) has been kicking her way into pretty much everyone's newsfeeds with her new project [Lady Parts](http://www.someladyparts.com), a blog that exposes the substratum of misogynist representation in casting breakdowns throughout the acting industry. While she does that, I occasionally install a friendly Twitter button. But stay tuned; a DH working group at Columbia (on whom more later) has plans to back online feminist activists who have been hacked, and we'll use rapid-response migration to Jekyll and GitHub Pages to join the fray. Surely what I've learned in the construction/compulsive maintenance of this blog can be put to some use....
