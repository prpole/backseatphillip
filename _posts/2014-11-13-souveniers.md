Less *from* a marriage than at the very beginning of one. Relics from that most surreal of months arrived in the various mails this week: the full complement of wedding photos and the long-awaited Tallinn/San Sebastian travel posters. We rode a ferry like the one in the Tallinn poster, from Helsinki to Tallinn. When we finally boarded after a harrowing morning, we found a floating wonderland: nobody sitting down except in front of a slot-machine or bar; Baltic Elvis impersonators; one man winning bingo *twice* in one sitting and managing not to tear his shirt off and run around the room---he didn't even break a *smile*. I'm pretty sure you can see his glum, bingo-winning face through one of the portholes on the poster....
