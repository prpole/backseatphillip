I'll probably just give them tuna. I've come to terms with the fact that they actually do have to eat meat, but I'm not ready to, like, grind up chickens or whatever the serious cat ladies do---hence the hail-mary inquiry, because if I could just have made them a cat-food lasagna, everything would be solved.
