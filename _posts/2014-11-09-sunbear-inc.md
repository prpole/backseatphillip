Brother bear is trying to come up with a name for his wood-goods (Brother Bear and Woodgoods, the garbage can is flowing). I express my reservations about Sun Bear Genaral Store on the grounds that nobody knows what a Sun Bear is. It looks like the resolution may be Ursus Solaris, a literal translation of Sun Bear into Latin. Apparently I'm assuming more people know Latin than know about Sun Bears, which begs the question: are people who know Latin more likely to know what a Sun Bear is?
