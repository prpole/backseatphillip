Nothing to make light of on November 24th, 2014. This is a rare documentary post for Backseat Phillip, and in a way maybe the most useful thing it can do is say: this is what the internet looked like on November 24th, 2014. 

This is what privilege looked like on November 24th, 2014, far from danger, watching as the black community was reminded that the law can kill them, but will not protect them.
