Office hours are for: writing about obscure(ish) concepts in Marx ("species-being") while simultaneously also googling the passages in Lucretius's *De Rerum Natura* where he talks about warpigs in an attempt to win a Men in Blazers tie. Which takes me back to bonkers monk drawings in bestiaries---not of course from *DRN*, but somehow I got there anyway.
