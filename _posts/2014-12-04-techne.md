Gotta make sure the Greek is justified. Hint: it's probably not. I want to have a PSA in which a bunch of grad students are given free liquor and get predictably tanked. Then, they're asked a series of increasingly difficult questions. First one to say something in Greek gets thrown in the tiger pit. The best I can predict for myself is that the tiger might not be hungry anymore by the time I get there.
