...though of course the question is whose words are doing the failing here. The thing about grad school is that, alongside everything you read that stays with you and quietly changes everything, there is the batshit. This is one example. It doesn't help that I'm reading it at a dead sprint, having started it today and needing to finish it by about this time tomorrow. Which is to say, tomorrow's Backseat Phillip will probably be another screenshot from this bonkers-ass novel.
