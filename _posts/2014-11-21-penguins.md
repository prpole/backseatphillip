I don't care how many papers I have to write or when exactly they're due again: I'm determined to make weekends and evenings a thing, at least sort of, preferably (but not definitely) through efficiency rather than laziness. What I don't know is whether I'm using sports as a way to do this (i.e. pencil in things I want to do) or whether I'm doing this so that I can watch sports.
