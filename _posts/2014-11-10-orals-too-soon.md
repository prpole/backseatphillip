It's probably too soon. It's definitely too soon. But then, it's always too soon. When you don't like the year it is, start planning for the year it will be: hence the tentative beginnings of my reading lists for next year's oral exams. This one will be one long argument between Marxists, ecocritics, and anyone else who wants to enter the fray.
