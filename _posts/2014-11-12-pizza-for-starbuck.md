I didn't make a Gmail account (or a Facebook, or a Twitter...) for my cat because I wanted her to have a robust web presence. Though, if it contributes to that, I'm all for it. I just needed a name for all my dummy accounts so everyone doesn't know I'm listening to Fergie (or whomever) on Spotify and ordered enough delivery to get a free Seamless snuggie. And test a broken Twitter API for this account, for example. So to the NSA, it looks like one S. Buck Polefrone-Day orders a lot of food in and listens to a lot of crap, and collects a lot of spam for someone who has never received a piece of personal correspondence....
