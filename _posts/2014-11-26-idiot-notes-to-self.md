I always write these notes to self. I could probably write an entire draft of bracketed statements saying things like, "\[say something about steinbeck's mustache, but don't make it obvious that yr talking about his mustache\]\[like, an introduction of sorts should go here\]" and so on. But now I have VIM and nifty color schemes, so my bullshit is purple.
